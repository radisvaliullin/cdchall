#
Given a random sequence of int elements:

[1,5,2,3,4,6]

Find length of longest subsequence generated by missing zero or more elements.\
Subsequence should have only list increasing elements.\
Order should be the same as in the original sequence.

For example:\
for sequence\
[1,5,2,3,4,6]\
longest subsequence is\
[1,2,3,4,6]\
length of longest subsequence is\
5

Or another example:\
seq:\
[1,5,2,3,9,5,6]\
subsec:\
[1,2,3,5,6]\
len:
5
